        <h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>The infrastructure project focuses on building the OpenStack private
cloud that will host the online tutorial application and eventually
the whole of <a href="http://puppetize.net">puppetize.net</a>. It builds on the
<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-openstack">OpenStack modules</a>
developed by Dan Bode (<a href="https://github.com/bodepd" class="user-mention">@bodepd</a>) at PuppetLabs and includes Vagrant
boxes and RSpec definitions for test-driven development.</p>

<p>The goal is to make it extremely easy to participate in the development
of the site itself and its underlying technology stack, such as OpenStack
and Puppet.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Before you begin, make sure that you have
<a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">VeeWee</a> and
<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> installed and working.</p>

<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/puppetize/infrastructure">infrastructure</a>
repository recursively, including all referenced submodules.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:puppetize/infrastructure
</code></pre>

<h2>Building Baseboxes</h2>

<p>Base boxes for the included Vagrant boxes can be built using VeeWee and
there is a Rake task which makes this a one-step process.</p>

<pre><code>$ (cd boxes/base &amp;&amp; rake install)
</code></pre>

<p>This will download the installation media for all supported operating
systems, perform a non-interactive installation, build Vagrant box
packages (in the boxes/base directory) and install those packages into
Vagrant.</p>

<p>You can free up some disk space afterwards by deleting the Vagrant box
package files, or you can keep them around to install them elsewhere.</p>

<pre><code>$ (cd boxes/base &amp;&amp; rake destroy)
</code></pre>

<h2>OpenStack Cloud Controller</h2>

<p>The OpenStack cloud controller includes a self-contained installation
of OpenStack, much like <a href="http://devstack.org/">devstack</a> but is entirely
provisioned via Puppet.  The cloud controller provides Horizon, a web-based
management interface for OpenStack at <a href="http://cloud.puppetize.net">http://cloud.puppetize.net</a>.</p>

<p>Try it out locally by starting the "cloud" box.</p>

<pre><code>$ (cd boxes/cloud &amp;&amp; vagrant up)
</code></pre>

<p>When Vagrant has finished provisioning the box, open
<a href="http://localhost:8080/horizon">http://localhost:8080/horizon</a> in a web
browser and log in using the username "admin" and password "changeme".</p>

<h2>Other Vagrant Boxes</h2>

<p>There are other Vagrant boxes in the <code>boxes</code> directory, such as
"devstack", which aren't part of the main infrastructure but are used
for development.  Each Vagrantfile normally contains the provisioning
instructions or the name of the top-level Puppet class which defines its
role.  Take a look and modify them, or add boxes as you wish.</p>

<h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>

<p>Execute RSpec code examples for Vagrant boxes using the top-level task
"spec:boxes".  This will perform some testing on the important Vagrant
boxes, such as the "cloud" box.</p>

<pre><code>$ rake spec:boxes
/usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 -S rspec ./spec/boxes/cloud_spec.rb ./spec/boxes/vagrant_spec.rb -c -fd -t vagrant
Run options:
  include {:vagrant=&gt;true}
  exclude {:basebox=&gt;#&lt;Proc:./spec/support/vagrant.rb:8&gt;}

Vagrant box 'cloud'
  with any basebox
    running OpenStack Dashboard
      presents a login screen

Vagrant box 'vagrant'
  with any basebox
    has a Vagrant 1.0.x executable in PATH
    has a "vagrant basebox" command (VeeWee)

Finished in 3 minutes 50.83 seconds
3 examples, 0 failures
</code></pre>

<p>Continuous integration is provided by
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/puppetize/infrastructure">Travis CI</a>, but is
currently limited as those builds don't include the Vagrant examples.</p>
