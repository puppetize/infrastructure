{"name":"puppetize.net/infrastructure","tagline":"Puppet manifests and Vagrant boxes for puppetize.net.","body":"What is this?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis repository contains [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) manifests and\r\n[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)/[VeeWee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee#readme)\r\ndefinitions for the infrastructure of [puppetize.net](http://puppetize.net),\r\ntopped with a bunch of high-level [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) tasks\r\nthat tie everything together.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make it extremely easy for anyone to set up development\r\nand production environments for the site itself (a\r\n[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) application) and its underlying\r\ntechnology stack, such as OpenStack and Puppet.\r\n\r\nRequirements for development\r\n============================\r\n\r\nThe only prerequisites to set up a development environment should be:\r\n\r\n* Ruby\r\n  * Rake\r\n  * RubyGems\r\n* [sudo](http://www.sudo.ws/) (if you're not root)\r\n\r\nThe Rake tasks then take care of installing Puppet via \"gem install\",\r\nunless it is already available, because that should work across most\r\noperating systems.  All other dependencies beyond Puppet, like Vagrant,\r\nare then installed with \"puppet apply\" (no existing Puppet master is\r\nrequired.)\r\n\r\nKnown limitations\r\n=================\r\n\r\n* Your operating system must be supported by Vagrant.\r\n* Vagrant 1.0.x, because more recent versions are not available as\r\n  a Gem and VeeWee doesn't work with newer Vagrant versions, yet.\r\n\r\nBuilding base boxes for Vagrant\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nBefore you can `vagrant up` the individual virtual machines in the\r\n`boxes/` subdirectory, you have to build the Vagrant base boxes.\r\nExecute the following command to build the required `.box` files and\r\nadd them to your Vagrant installation (unless they exist already):\r\n\r\n``$ (cd boxes/base && rake install)``\r\n\r\nTo save disk space, you can remove base box VMs and `.box` files\r\nafterwards, leaving only the installed base boxes in `~/.vagrant.d`:\r\n\r\n``$ (cd boxes/base && rake destroy)``\r\n","google":"UA-40430933-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
