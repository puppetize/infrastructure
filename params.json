{"name":"puppetize.net/infrastructure","tagline":"Puppet manifests and Vagrant boxes for puppetize.net.","body":"About This Project\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure project focuses on building the OpenStack private\r\ncloud that will host the online tutorial application and eventually\r\nthe whole of [puppetize.net](http://puppetize.net). It builds on the\r\n[OpenStack modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-openstack)\r\ndeveloped by Dan Bode (@bodepd) at PuppetLabs and includes Vagrant\r\nboxes and RSpec definitions for test-driven development.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make it extremely easy to participate in the development\r\nof the site itself and its underlying technology stack, such as OpenStack\r\nand Puppet.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n===============\r\n\r\nBefore you begin, make sure that you have\r\n[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com),\r\n[VeeWee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) and\r\n[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) installed and working.\r\n\r\nClone the [infrastructure](https://github.com/puppetize/infrastructure)\r\nrepository recursively, including all referenced submodules.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:puppetize/infrastructure\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding Baseboxes\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nBase boxes for the included Vagrant boxes can be built using VeeWee and\r\nthere is a Rake task which makes this a one-step process.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ (cd boxes/base && rake install)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download the installation media for all supported operating\r\nsystems, perform a non-interactive installtion, build Vagrant box\r\npackages (in the boxes/base directory) and install those packages into\r\nVagrant.\r\n\r\nYou can free up some disk space afterwards by deleting the Vagrant box\r\npackage files, or you can keep them around to install them elsewhere.\r\n```\r\n$ (cd boxes/base && rake destroy)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpenStack Cloud Controller\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe OpenStack cloud controller includes a self-contained installation\r\nof OpenStack, much like [devstack](http://devstack.org/) but is entirely\r\nprovisioned via Puppet.  The cloud controller provides Horizon, a web-based\r\nmanagement interface for OpenStack at http://cloud.puppetize.net.\r\n\r\nTry it out locally by starting the \"cloud\" box.\r\n```\r\n$ (cd boxes/cloud && vagrant up)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen Vagrant is done, point your web browser at http://localhost:8080 and\r\nlog in using the username \"admin\" and password \"changeme\".\r\n","google":"UA-40430933-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
